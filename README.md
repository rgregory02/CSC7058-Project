# CSC7058 Project: Biography Builder Tool

This project enables users to build structured, timeline-based biographies using real data, metadata, and AI-enhanced workflows. It is part of a Master’s project for CSC7058 – MSc Software Development at Queen’s University Belfast.

## 💡 Key Features

- Partial name search for fast biography lookup  
- Label-based filtering (occupation, location, relationships, etc.)  
- Confidence intervals for all selections  
- Folder-based taxonomy structure (labels + biographies)  
- Nested labels and smart biography suggestions  
- **Flexible label creation and ingest**:  
  - Manual creation of labels with metadata and properties  
  - GPT-powered natural language ingest: users phrase queries in plain English (e.g. “Add famous hospitals in London”), which are converted into structured API queries; results appear as suggested labels for review before saving  
  - External dataset linkage: integration with APIs such as **Wikidata (SPARQL)** or **REST endpoints** allows labels to be drawn directly from authoritative sources  
- **“Most-like” functionality**: compare biographies to find the closest matches, with similarity scores based on overlapping labels and confidence intervals, and rationale chips explaining why entities align or diverge  
- Relationship-based person linking with confidence scoring  
- Manual editing and entry support  
- Archive and restore functionality  
- Consistent, type-agnostic design (works for people, buildings, organisations, events)

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create a virtual environment (e.g. `python3 -m venv venv39`)  
3. Activate the environment:  
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv39/bin/activate`  
   - Windows: `venv39\Scripts\activate`  
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
5. Launch the app: `python general.py`  
6. Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000

## 🧪 Testing

Automated tests are provided in the `tests/` folder, using **pytest**. These validate key API endpoints (e.g. `/api/type/person/labels.json`) and ensure JSON responses include expected fields such as `ok` flags and non-empty label arrays.

To run all tests: `pytest -q`

Tests use Flask’s `test_client` so they run fully locally without requiring the app to be deployed to a live server.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `general.py` – Main Flask app and route logic  
- `types/` – Organised by type (e.g. person, building, organisation), each with `labels/` and `biographies/` subfolders  
- `templates/` – Jinja2 HTML templates (multi-step wizard + viewer)  
- `static/` – CSS styles and JavaScript assets  
- `tests/` – Pytest suite for API endpoints and core functions  
- `utils/` – Helper functions (label parsing, ingest, similarity metrics, etc.)    
- `.vscode/` – Local development config (ignored by Git)  
- `venv39/` – Virtual environment (ignored from Git)

## ⚙️ Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for the full list.  

**Notable libraries**:  
- Flask (web framework + Jinja2 templating)  
- Requests / HTTPX (API integration)  
- OpenAI Python SDK (LLM-assisted label suggestions & ingest)  
- Pytest (automated testing)
